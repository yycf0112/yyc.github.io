###  **Data Analysis Portfolio**


### **1. Udacity Free Trial Screener A/B Testing — User Quality Filtering**

*Product experimentation to optimize conversion quality without hurting revenue*

* Designed and analyzed a randomized A/B test measuring the effect of a time commitment screener on user behavior.
* Conducted data validation, traffic balance checks, and cleaned missing values symmetrically to maintain test validity.
* Performed Z-tests and confidence interval analysis on gross and net conversion.
* Found a **statistically significant 1.25% drop in enrollments** with **no significant impact on paying users**.
* **Recommendation:** Deploy the screener to improve user quality and reduce downstream churn risk.
* **Business Impact:** Demonstrated data-driven product decision-making with clear statistical rigor.


### **2. Cookie Cats A/B Testing — Game Design Optimization**

*Product feature evaluation through user retention analysis*

* Analyzed a live A/B test comparing gate placements at level 30 (control) and 40 (treatment).
* Used Mann-Whitney U and Chi-Square tests to assess retention and engagement.
* Identified a **significant drop in 7-day retention** for gate\_40 with **no engagement benefit**.
* Recommended retaining gate\_30 to preserve early user retention and reduce churn.


### **3. Booking.com Price Prediction**

*Predictive modeling to estimate hotel prices based on property and customer data*
