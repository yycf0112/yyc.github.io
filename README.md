Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space includes projects focused on data analysis and predictive modeling.

1. Booking.com Price Prediction
In this project, I analyze accommodation pricing data from Booking.com to predict the prices of hotels and properties based on various features such as location, room type, customer ratings, and amenities.

Key Highlights:
Data Collection: Scraped data from Booking.com, including details on properties, pricing, and customer ratings.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed correlations between features like location, amenities, and price.
Machine Learning Models: Built and evaluated models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting to predict pricing.
Feature Engineering: Created features such as Recency (the time since the customer's last booking) to improve model predictions.

2. Customer Personality Analysis
This project involves analyzing customer data to identify different personality types based on their purchasing behavior, preferences, and interactions.

Key Highlights:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw customer data for analysis.
Customer Segmentation: Used clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to group customers into different personality types based on purchasing behavior.
Insights & Visualizations: Provided insights into how different personality types interact with products, and visualized the results through various graphs and plots.
