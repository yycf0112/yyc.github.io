This space includes projects focused on data analysis.

**1.Booking.com Price Prediction**

  In this project, I analyze accommodation pricing data from Booking.com to predict the prices of hotels and properties based on various features such as location, room type, customer    ratings, and amenities.

  **Key Highlights:**
  
  (1) Data Collection: Scraped data from Booking.com, including details on properties, pricing, and customer ratings.
  
  (2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed correlations between features like location, amenities, and price.
  
  (3) Machine Learning Models: Built and evaluated models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting to predict pricing.
  
  (4) Feature Engineering: Created features such as Recency (the time since the customer's last booking) to improve model predictions.

**2. Customer Personality Analysis**

  This project involves analyzing customer data to identify different personality types based on their purchasing behavior, preferences, and interactions.
  
  **Key Highlights:**
  
  (1) Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw customer data for analysis.
  
  (2) Customer Segmentation: Used clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to group customers into different personality types based on purchasing behavior.
  
  (3) Insights & Visualizations: Provided insights into how different personality types interact with products, and visualized the results through various graphs and plots.
